☐ Add Option Parser

☐ Make GUI @low
    ☐ ImGui

✔ Add sound lib @high @done(19-01-25 17:52)
    ✔ Un4Seen Bass @high @done(19-01-15 18:50)
        It is important to ALWAYS load mp3 with BASS_STREAM_DECODE if we want to use them in BASS_FX_CreateTempo and change their tempo. 
        1. It will only play the normal Channel if its NOT Decoded, CreateTempo Re-Encodes the stream when calling and creating a new channel

☐ Code cleanup (continuos) via Clang-Tidy and have other people look over it @high

        ✔ make sure to remove the already played elements, otherwise we would have unwanted behaviour @created(19-01-21 14:22) @done(19-01-25 17:52)

☐ Improve Parsing of files @high
        Currently, im parsing over the same array of strings (the file) for different things. combining this would probably reduce cpu usage
☐ Parse files multi-threaded @low

☐ For Search purposes, create SortBy-Only objects of Beatmaps @created(19-01-12 15:09)

☐ Settings file @created(19-01-20 21:33)

✔ Figure out why deleting a Beatmap doesnt give back all the memory @high @started(19-01-03 23:21) @done(19-01-03 23:23) @lasted(2m25s)
    See commit.
    Basically, I deleted all my deconstructors and let the compiler handle things for me. Smart pointers delete themselves when out of scope. We now have no memory leaks when (potentially) reading maps as needed and deleting them when we are done with them

✔ Cache beatmap locations instead of parsing through the folder everytime @created(19-01-12 15:07) @done(19-01-17 00:36)
 
✔ Refactor into a DLL @done(19-01-12 15:06)
