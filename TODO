        I will use this, as i dont plan on multi-platform just yet. Might switch to OpenGL and some sort of Custom GUI inside of that to make all happen

    ✘ Un4Seen Bass @high @cancelled(19-01-09 13:31)
    Possible Options that i scouted:
        ✘ MMSystem.h (Windows Driver) @cancelled(19-01-04 19:42)
        ✘ Un4Seen Bass + Bass_FX (High Pitch, "Nightcore Mode") @cancelled(19-01-09 13:31)
            This seems likely, documentation is provided in the download.

☐ Implement Spinners @low
    ☐ Spinner Hitsounds
☐ Implement Sliders @low
    ☐ Slider Hitsound @low
        ☐ SliderHead @low
        ☐ SliderTick @low
        ☐ SliderEnd @low

✔ Implement Vector of All .osu files @started(19-01-05 14:43) @done(19-01-05 14:55) @lasted(12m25s)

☐ Improve Parsing of files @high
        Currently, im parsing over the same array of strings (the file) for different things. combining this would probably reduce cpu usage
☐ Parse files multi-threaded @low

☐ Support Custom Hitsound Files + Indicies @low 
✔ Figure out why deleting a Beatmap doesnt give back all the memory @high @started(19-01-03 23:21) @done(19-01-03 23:23) @lasted(2m25s)
    See commit.
    Basically, I deleted all my deconstructors and let the compiler handle things for me. Smart pointers delete themselves when out of scope. We now have no memory leaks when (potentially) reading maps as needed and deleting them when we are done with them
 
☐ Refactor into a DLL 
✔ publish seperatly on Github under GNU License @done(19-01-09 13:32)
